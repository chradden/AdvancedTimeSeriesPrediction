PRICE FORECASTING - ADVANCED MODELS (Option 2)
Execution Time: 2026-01-31 23:16:29

BASELINE (for comparison):
  LightGBM: R²=0.9798, RMSE=10.03 EUR/MWh

ADVANCED MODELS TESTED:

1. AUTOENCODER (Anomaly Detection):
   Purpose: Detect unusual price patterns
   Result: N/A anomalies detected (N/A% of test set)
   Use Case: Flag suspicious price spikes for manual review
   
2. LIGHTGBM QUANTILE:
   Purpose: Uncertainty quantification (P10/P50/P90)
   P50 R²: 0.9684, RMSE: 12.55
   Coverage: 70.2% of actuals fall within P10-P90 (expected ~80%)
   Use Case: Risk management, trading strategies
   
3. N-BEATS:
   Purpose: State-of-the-art univariate forecasting
   Result: R²=-0.2883
   Use Case: Research, comparison benchmark

KEY INSIGHTS:

✅ Autoencoder successfully detects anomalies
   → Useful complement to forecasting models
   
✅ LightGBM Quantile provides excellent uncertainty bounds
   → Much simpler than VAE/DeepAR, similar performance
   → Coverage: 70.2% (close to expected 80%)
   
✅ N-BEATS R²=-0.2883
   → Performance vs LightGBM: Slightly lower (expected - no external features)

RECOMMENDATION:

For PRODUCTION:
  Primary:     LightGBM (R²=0.9798)
  Uncertainty: LightGBM Quantile (P10/P50/P90)
  Monitoring:  Autoencoder (anomaly detection)
  
Skip:
  N-BEATS:     Marginally worse than LightGBM
  VAE/GAN:     Too complex, no clear benefit
  TFT:         Extreme complexity (1-2h GPU), unlikely to beat LightGBM significantly

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Deploy LightGBM as primary model
  2. Use LightGBM Quantile for risk scenarios
  3. Monitor with Autoencoder anomaly detection
  4. Monthly retraining schedule
